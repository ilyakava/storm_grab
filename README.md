You can either:
1. Search for a list of queries on architizer
    * type `./bin/search ` and then drag and drop a csv file containing queries in each row into the terminal
    * every row in the csv becomes a single query
    * the output is a `table.csv` file
2. Scrape architecture websites for new project entries
    * type `./bin/scrape` and scrape several architechture websites for entries
    * the output is a `table.html` file
